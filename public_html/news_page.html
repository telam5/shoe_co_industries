	<article><h3>Volunteering: September 6th, 2021</h3>

		<p>On Labor Day, our company had the day off and we decided as a company 
		to help around the Indianola community. All the opportunities we had were
		endless:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Mowed Lawns</li>
			<li>Cleaned Cars</li>
			<li>Visit Local Restaurants</li>
			<li>Go to the homeless shelter</li>
		</ul>

		<p>We love volunteering within our community to those who have always
		supported our company from the beginning to now. This helps grow not 
		only our business but our community as a whole. We will try to get the 
		word out when we are volunteering and helping out the community so others
		can come join in on the fun. We want others to come out of their way to 
		not only visit Indianola but because they love the people and of course 
		the shoes!</p>
